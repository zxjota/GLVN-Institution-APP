    <p>GLVN Institution (“we,” “our,” or “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you use the GLVN Institution application and related services (collectively, the “App”). By using the App, you agree to the practices described here.</p>

    <h2>1) Information We Collect</h2>

      <li><strong>Support Communications:</strong> Information you provide when you contact us (including the content of messages and email address).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2) How We Use Information</h2>

      <li>Analyze aggregate usage to guide product decisions and new features.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms and policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Legal Bases (EEA/UK Users)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contract:</strong> Processing necessary to provide the App you requested.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> To improve, secure, and support the App (balanced against your rights).</li>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> When required by law (e.g., certain analytics or optional features). You may withdraw consent at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Obligation:</strong> When processing is necessary to comply with applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with vendors who help us operate the App (e.g., hosting, analytics, crash reporting) under confidentiality obligations.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal & Safety:</strong> We may disclose information to comply with laws, legal process, or to protect rights, safety, and security.</li>
      <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred as permitted by law.</li>

    <h2>6) Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

    <h2>7) Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or under 16 in the EEA/UK without appropriate consent). If you believe a child has provided personal data, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>8) International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) to protect cross-border transfers.</p>

    <h2>9) Your Rights & Choices</h2>

      <li><strong>Access, Rectification, Deletion:</strong> You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information.</li>
      <li><strong>Portability:</strong> You may request a copy of certain information in a portable format.</li>
      <li><strong>Restriction & Objection (EEA/UK):</strong> You may request we restrict processing or object to certain processing based on legitimate interests.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent Preferences:</strong> Where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw consent at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Controls:</strong> Use your device/OS settings to manage permissions (e.g., notifications, file access).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11) Third-Party Services</h2>
